# Non-ergodic collision rates
 Scripts used for the article titled "the unreasonable effectiveness of the n-sigma-v approximation" by Elisha Modelevsky, Nicholas C. Stone and Re'em Sari.
 
* smbh_tref_to_tdep.py plots the ratio of refresh time to depletion time in SMBH and IMBH scenarios - single stars and binary systems.
* dc_qupiter.py plots the critical diameter, above which an object would experience a reduced collision rate (taking into account GR and "Qupiter" precessions).
